- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheBest80WPM, also known as anthony
- 👀 I’m interested in a career in astronomy, and enjoy dabbling in systems programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and some assembly
- 🏫 I am currently a high school student working on whatever I can
- ✨ I like to recreate what is already made, since it gives me that personal touch I love more than anything
